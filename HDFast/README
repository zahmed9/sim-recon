The GlueX Spectrometer for Hall D

HDFast is a fast and flexible simulation program based upon the MCFast framework developed by the simulation group at Fermilab. MCFast consists of a set of modularized Monte Carlo library routines; it is designed to perform parameterized tracking by assembling a covariance matrix for each track that takes into account materials, efficiencies, and resolutions for all measurements planes, and use this matrix to smear the track parameters randomly. In principle, the distribution of smeared tracks produced by this method would be similar to the distribution of real tracks that were measured by a real detector(with the same parameters) and analyzed with an idealized track fitting procedure. 


Building HDFast:

The Following Environmental variables must be defined: $CRNLIB (points to your cern libs) 
and $HALLD_HOME (points to a directory where $HALLD_HOME/src/HDFast is the HDFast cvs directory)

Example are:
			% echo $CRNLIB 
				/usr/local/cern/2000/lib	
			% echo $HALLD_HOME
				/home/gluex



The library libTMCFast.a from the mcroot cvs repository must be built prior to building HDFast.

			% cd $HALLD_HOME/src/mcroot 
			% make all
			% cd $HALLD_HOME/src/HDFast


Now source 
	$HALLD_HOME/src/HDFast/setup5_2.Linux_gcc3x 
					or
	$HALLD_HOME/src/HDFast/setup5_2.Linux_gcc2x 

			depending on your version of gcc  (see gcc --version)

Ready to make HDFast

	
			% make HDFast



The HDFast run time environment:

	Note!! HDFast, during run time, needs certain environmental variables defined.  Therefor,
	       it is suggested that one adds adds the following lines to cshrc (or equivalent)
	       for automatic sourcing.


		#
		# Needed for HDFast building and running
		setenv HALLD_HOME  /your/home/gluex
		source $HALLD_HOME/src/HDFast/setup5_2.Linux_gcc3x  # or _gcc2x

Cebaf's Meson Spectrometer for HallD

HDFast is a fast and flexible simulation program based upon the MCFast framework developed by the simulation group at Fermilab. MCFast consists of a set of modularized Monte Carlo library routines; it is designed to perform parameterized tracking by assembling a covariance matrix for each track that takes into account materials, efficiencies, and resolutions for all measurements planes, and use this matrix to smear the track parameters randomly. In principle, the distribution of smeared tracks produced by this method would be similar to the distribution of real tracks that were measured by a real detector(with the same parameters) and analyzed with an idealized track fitting procedure. 

Running HDFast

First one must generate the MC events. Monte Carlo events can be generated using the program genr8 or cwrap . Both programs generate peripheral phase space Monte Carlo events where events can be produced which describe a complex decay chain of intermediary states. Both meson and baryon decay chains are allowed, but with a limiting assumption of a t-channel production process. Given in this directory is an example genr8 input file: "example.input". To run genr8 execute:

	genr8 -M100 -Aexample.ascii < example.input

This will generate 100 MC events in ascii format which are then read in by
HDFast using the perl script "run_hdfast". But first source halldrc from your .cshrc file.

       run_hdfast -N100 -texample -n6

In addition to the default debug files: example.hbook and example.log; there
is an example.rdt file which is a ROOT tree file that contains all data groups (branches) for the event. The file can then be analyzed using root macros or programs developed in the mcroot subsystem.

Building HDFast:

HDFast requires the following fermi lab products(these 
are precompiled libraries. Future plans include placing the source files in 
the halld CVS repository. Currently there is no support for a MCFast version 
for Linux) A distributions of these products can be obtained via ftp from 
ftp.fnal.gov (username:ftp).  The site is restricted  to registered users. A 
registration form can be obtained in the top level directory at the  site.

Caution! Some of these packages are currently in development, so using another
 version of any product where a specific version is listed may break mcfast.

        stdhep v4_04
        qq v9_2b
	mcfast v4_1

The above packages support only the following platforms: 
	OSF1, HP-UX,IRIX, IRIX64, SunOS, Ultrix, Aix, Linux(except for mcfast)

****************************************
*	FIVE EASY STEPS TO USE MCFAST  *
****************************************

[1]	Get the Packages: stdhep, qq, mcfast
	from fermi lab; and HDFast & stdhep_translators
	from the HallD CVS repository.

	Remeber to have halldrc sourced from your .cshrc file
		


[2]
	Add a symbolic link.
		ln -s  $MCFAST_DIR/db  $HDFAST_DIR/db
		# This is NEEDED to run mcfast everytime!
[3]
	Make the StdHep translators.
		cd  $STDHEP_TRANS_DIR
		make all
[4]
	Make HDFast
		cd $HDFAST_DIR
		make HDFast

[5]	Call or email eugenio@ernest.phys.cmu.edu if you run
        into any problems.

Hello all,
                 
You must set the env $LIBMCFAST_DIR in the setup.csh file to 
point to your libmcfast location.  The file $LIBMCFAST_DIR/setup.csh
needs to be sourced before building the libs and running the programs. 
It is recommended that you source this file from you .cshrc file or from
 a common .halldrc file.  For example:

        #
        # MCFast environments
        #
        setenv LIBMCFAST_DIR /home/halld/src/libmcfast
        source $LIBMCFAST_DIR/setup.csh
                                            

Once this is done, you should be able to make all of the associated mcfast, 
stdhep, and qq libs by executing a "make all" in the $LIBMCFAST_DIR.


What will happen:

	1] The old objects(if exist) will be removed but not the 
	   the libs them selves.
	
	2] Next, the dir trees are built and dependencies checked

	3] all objects and libs are built for  qq and stdhep.

	4] all C and C++ objects are built and the libs are updated
	   with these objects.  To rebuild the fortran objects one needs
	   the absoft compiler, but these objects do not need to be built.





Don't hesitate to call or email me if you run into problems.

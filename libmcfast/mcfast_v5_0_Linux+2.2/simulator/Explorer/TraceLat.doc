TraceLat
%%------------ DESCRIPTION ------------
This Module displays the traces generated by the
McFast tracking.
%%------------ INPUTS ------------
%PORT PickTraceInfo
%TYPE Parameter
%OPTIONAL 
This parameter controls whether to display the hits of the individual 
traces.  Another option is to turn off the display of a trace all together.
%PORT PickHepNum
%TYPE Parameter
%OPTIONAL 
The HEP particle number of the picked track.
%%------------ WIDGETS ------------
%PORT Filename
%TYPE File Browser
Use the file brower to input the file with STDHEP information,
Offline track information and trace information here
%PORT NextEvent
%TYPE Button
Use to go to the next event.  In the current implementation, the first
"event" is really the file header.
%PORT PlotTrace
%TYPE Radio Box
%MENUITEM off
%MENUITEM on
Use this button to display the traces of charged particles which
were not found as reconstructed tracks.  Green traces are positively
charged, yellow are negatively charge.
%PORT PlotTrack
%TYPE Radio Box
%MENUITEM off
%MENUITEM on
Use this button to display the traces of particle that were found as
reconstructed traces.  All particles will show as red.
%PORT PlotNeutral
%TYPE Radio Box
%MENUITEM off
%MENUITEM on
Use this button to display all neutral traces as blue.
%PORT PlotHit
%TYPE Radio Box
%MENUITEM off
%MENUITEM on
Use this button to display the hits on the tracks.  This option takes a while
to render and longer to move.  Zoom in to the view the tracks before turning on
this option
%PORT MinEta
%TYPE Dial
Controls the minimum eta of the traces that will be displayed.
%PORT MaxEta
%TYPE Dial
Controls the maximum eta of the traces that will be displayed.
%PORT EventNumber
%TYPE Text
Displays the event number.  Only for information at this time, although I
could make it used to select which event to display.
%PORT PlotAxis
%TYPE Radio Box
%MENUITEM off
%MENUITEM on
If this button is on, arrows showing the positive x,y,and z axis will be shown
with the event
%PORT MomSwitch
%TYPE Radio Box
%MENUITEM Momentum
%MENUITEM Transverse Momentum
Controls whether the momentum cut takes place in momentum  or
transverse momentum.
%PORT MinMom
%TYPE Dial
Controls the minimum momentum cut.  
%PORT ResetView
%TYPE Button
Use to return to the default view of the traces before picking.  The
reset view feature will not override momentum, eta, or display parameters.
%%------------ OUTPUTS ------------
%PORT geom
%TYPE Geometry
This is the actual information sent to the render
%PORT hepdata
%TYPE Lattice
%CONSTRAINT 1-D
%CONSTRAINT float
%CONSTRAINT uniform
This contains the information about the particles that is
displayed by the trace pick module
%PORT filename
%TYPE Parameter
This port can be hooked to the geom_filename input port of the DetDisplay
module to insure that the traces and geometery being displayed come from the
same McFast run.
%%------------ PROBLEMS ------------
It takes an AGE to render the hits.  Could use fewer trace points in the 
non-magnetic region to display connected traces, which might improve
performance. Could use event number display to select event.  
The first event is not the first event, but the header.  Could use HEP tree 
information to display particles by decay chain.

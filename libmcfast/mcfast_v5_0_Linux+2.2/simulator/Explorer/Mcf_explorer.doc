A 3-d event display has been developed for use with McFast.  This display has
been written in the form of Explorer Modules.  You need access to Explorer v3.0
in order to use the event display.

Currently five separate modules are used.  Brief descriptions follow and full
documentation is available in $MCFAST_DIR/Explorer/*.doc.  Additionally, online
help is available with each module

Explorer Module DetDisplay
v2.0
This module displays the detector geometry.  The input file can be
a dbin file or an McFast file with Geometery.
Be sure to have defined a soft link to the db directory containing the
templates in the area from which you will be getting your .db files.
ln -s $MCFAST_DIR/db db

After the geometry has been read in, the list of objects will appear in the
scrolled list box.  The name will be of the form DEVXXX_NAME. 
Many devices are displayed as more than one object.  For example, each layer of
silicon associated with a single silicon detector will appear as a separate
device.  To edit a device, select that device by clicking on it in the scrolled
list.  The current display parameters for that device will
appear on the widgets.  The detector display will remain in the Render, but the
modifications will not be displayed.  Multiple items can be selected.
Modify the display parameters as desired, using the Explorer Color Editor 
module to define the colors and the panel widgets to define the other
properties.  Modify as many detectors as desired remembering to click on each
detector before you modify it.  When modifications are complete, click on
display.  After all modification are complete, a configuration file can be
written out to save the parameters.  That file can be read in later to
establish personal defaults.

This module can be used with TraceLat to form an event display with traces and
detectors.

Explorer Module DetPick 
v1.0
This module allows the user to find the name of a detector system
by picking on that object.  Warning! The object displayed is the first
object hit by the pick.  Only one object is chosen.  Please remember that many
detectors come in "families" as each layer is displayed as a separate object.
This information can be used with DetDisplay to pick detector components
to modify.
  
Explorer Module TraceLat
v1.3
This module generates displays of McFast traces.  The user can optionally
display traces, traces found as reconstructed tracks and neutral traces.  It is
also possible to display the location of hits on traces.  The p/pt minimum and
the minimum and maximum eta for the traces can be selected.  The radius of the 
traces can also be controlled to facilitate studying traces in an inner
tracking region.  Additionally thhe x, y, and z axis can be displayed.  This 
module requires McFio output of an McFast run that has the STDHEP, offline track,
trace and hit information. 

Explorer Module TraceInfo
v1.0
This module displays trace information from picked traces

Explorer Module TracePick  
v1.0
This module handles trace picking.  Picked tracks can either have information
displayed about them, or can be used to selectively turn on the hits on an
individual trace or can be used to not display an individual trace.

MAPS:  Three maps are available

DetDisplay -- only displays detector.  Use this map to edit the detector and
make a configuration file.
TraceDisplay -- only displays traces and picking information.
TraceDet     -- displays traces and detector together.  For use only
with McFio output containing geomtery and trace information.  Enter file name
in the TraceLat module.

The .explorerrc file should be part of the standard McFast setup.  This file
will define the available modules and maps.  The maps appear as blue buttons in
the Explorer library module.

To lauch a map from within Explorer, click on the desired map and drag it to
the Map Editor.  Alternatively, a map can be launched from the command line:

explorer -m DesiredMap.map &

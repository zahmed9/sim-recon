The Simulation Group at Fermilab has developed a new fast Monte Carlo 
package MCFast for detector design studies.  The goal of MCFast 
is to provide a general framework for the comparison of differing 
detector geometries and to simulate the production and decay of 
B hadrons in a collider environment.  MCFast, however, is
flexible enough that it can be used as a framework to simulate other physics 
processes at colliders or fixed target experiments.<P> 

The code is written primarily in Fortran and C and is interfaced
to the standard HEP event generators 
<A HREF="http://www-pat.fnal.gov/mcgen/lund/lund.html">Pythia</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www-pat.fnal.gov/mcgen/herwig/index.html">Herwig</A> and Isajet
through the <A HREF="http://www-pat.fnal.gov/stdhep.html">STDHEP</A> interface. 
The decay of charm and bottom particles is handled by 
<A HREF="http://www-pat.fnal.gov/mcgen/qq/qq.html">QQ</A>, 
a Monte Carlo package developed for CLEO.
A 3-D Graphics package based on SGI-Explorer has been developed to
display the detector  geometry, tracks and hits.  An Inventor based display
package is under development<P> 
   
The primary goal of MCFast is speed and flexibility which is achieved
through parameterization.  The emphasis of the program is fast tracking 
which is based on a Kalman filter technique.  Hit generation has been 
included in the MCFast package and is under development. An interface 
between the MCFast geometry and 
<A HREF="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/geant/index.html">GEANT</A> has been written to 
enable more detailed simulations.   Parameterized calorimetry inside the MCFast framework 
has been implemented in the recent release.<P>

The current release of MCFast is available on fnalu:  setup mcfast<P>
The latest version of MCFast is v5_0. <P>

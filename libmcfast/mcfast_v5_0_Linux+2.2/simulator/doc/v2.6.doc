Updates for MCFast v2_6

1) Tracing updates 

Updates to tracing to allow the option of including of  multiple scattering,
dedx and bremsstrahlung during the trace.  By default, these options are turned
OFF.  

If any of these options are enabled the  tracing can only be done in planar or cylindrical
geometries, and not in mixed geometries.   These "non-ideal" traces generated
by any of these options can be used for hit based studies.  They are not also not compatible with trk_offline that is
provided in v2_6 of MCFast.  This feature will be available in v3_0 of MCFast.

Forward tracking disks are included in the geometry structures, but not yet
used in trk_offline.


2) Calorimeter and Absorber Updates

Absorbers and calorimeters can now be box shaped as well as cylindrical.
   
Absorbers are now treated as calorimeters without hit generation.  That is,
showers can be generated inside absorbers.

The number of layers in each calorimeter is now required in the db file.  Be
sure to update your geometry.db files!

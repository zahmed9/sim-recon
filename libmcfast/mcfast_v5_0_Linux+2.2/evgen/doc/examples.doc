The following products need to be defined:

	setup cern
	setup lund
	setup isajet
	setup herwig
	setup qq
	setup stdhep

See http://www-pat.fnal.gov/stdhep.html for a table of stdhep and
related product versions.  Because common blocks and particle numbers
can change between event generator releases, it is important to
use the correct set of products.

File extension conventions:

	.hwg	- input file for herwig
	.isa	- input file for isajet
	.pyt	- input file for pythia
	.std	- input file for stdhep
	.lpt	- "line printer" output
	.evt	- native mode event files as written by stdhep
	.f	- standard fortran
	.F	- fortran that will be passed through the c preprocessor
	.rz	- hbook histogram or ntuple files (readable by paw)
	.fz	- zebra event files

Example executables:

	herwig_exam
	isajet_exam
	pythia_exam 
	read_xdr 

For all examples, the events are put into the HEPEVT common block and 
written to disk by stdhep, using mcfio.

The evgen library is $MCFLIB/libevgen.a.
Look under $EVGEN_DIR/example for link examples.
The basic executables are in $MCFBIN.

Before running the  simple examples in $EVGEN_DIR/example/simple, 
"source define.user".  This will define the environmental variable 
QQ_USER_FILE.  It also defines ISAJET_DECAY for use with the 
QQ/isajet example.  If you are just running the isajet example, 
then undefine ISAJET_DECAY with "unsetenv ISAJET_DECAY".

The examples use pythia, herwig, or isajet to generate b events.
All examples may optionally decay particles with QQ.  
Read_xdr reads events from an event data file.

To run an executable, type, for instance, $MCFBIN/pythia_exam.
The following command line arguments are recognized:

	-f input_command_file
	-l ascii_output_file
	-o event_output_file
	-i event_input_file
	-hb hbook_output_file
	-qq (use QQ for particle decay)
	-h  (display help message)

Pythia_exam and herwig_exam use input files.  Isajet_exam must use
command line options:

	$MCFBIN/herwig_exam -f qq_herwig_exam.hwg

	$MCFBIN/isajet_exam -qq -l qq_isajet_exam.lpt -o qq_isajet_exam.evt \
		-hb qq_isajet_exam.rz

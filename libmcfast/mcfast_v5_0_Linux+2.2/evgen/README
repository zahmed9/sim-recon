This is the event generator area.

The following products need to be defined:

	setup cern
	setup lund
	setup isajet
	setup herwig
	setup -d qq
	setup -t stdhep

File extension conventions:

	.hwg	- input file for herwig
	.isa	- input file for isajet
	.pyt	- input file for pythia
	.std	- input file for stdhep
	.lpt	- "line printer" output
	.evt	- native mode event files as written by stdhep
	.f	- standard fortran
	.F	- fortran that will be passed through the c preprocessor
	.rz	- hbook histogram or ntuple files (readable by paw)
	.fz	- zebra event files

For all examples, the events are put into the HEPEVT common block and 
written to disk as xdr files by stdhep.

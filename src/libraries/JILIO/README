README  JILIO
12/13/05  D. Lawrence

This directory contains source and script to implement object
I/O using the JIL package. Since the information used to
make the serializers is obtained from executables that
have already been compiled and linked, a more complicated
build scheme is used here. In order to minimize redundant
information in the respository, the serializer methods and
headers are not kept there at all and must be generated from
the header files in ../include. Here is a description of the
build process for JILIO:

1. The default Makefile is used to do two things 1.) run
the make_serializers script found in this directory and
2.) invoke gmake using Makefile.bms. It also has a "clean"
target that removes all generated files and then inokes
"make clean" using Makefile.bms. It is done this way because
"make_serializers" may or may not update the hd_serializers.xml
file. In order for gmake to use the date to determine
whether or not to re-generate the actual serializer methods,
this must be done in two stages (i.e. two Makefiles).

2. The make_serializers script builds a temporary executable
and then mines the class information from it. It does this
in a tricky way so as to avoid having to compile the entire
Hall-D source tree. See the notes at the top of the
make_serializers script for more details.

3. The Makefile.bms is the standard library-generating makefile,
but with one extra rule that is used to generated hd_serializers.cc
from hd_serializers.xml (if needed). It will also copy the
hd_serializers.h and hd_classes.h headers into ../include.

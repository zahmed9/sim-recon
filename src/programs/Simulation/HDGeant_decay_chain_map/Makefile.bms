# Mac OS X 10.5 seems to have a picky linker that spits out
# tons of warnings about "can't find atom for N_GSYM stabs"
# for each of the cernlib routines.
# I can't find much on the web about it and don't recall
# anyone else using 10.5 complaining. No such warnings seem to
# exist for pure C++ code with no FORTRAN. The fix is
# therefore to supress all warnings for HDGeant, but only
# for this specific platform/OS since a global solution
# applied through BMS core files would supress warnings
# uneccessarily.

C This is the control file for the GEANT simulation
C Parameters defined in this file control the kind
C and extent of simulation that is performed.  The
C full list of options is given in section BASE-40
C of the GEANT manual.  In addition, some new cards
C have been defined to point to the location of the
C input files containing the events to be simulated.
C For example, the 4-card sequence:
C
C     file 'phi-1680.hddm'
C     skip 25
C
C instructs HDGeant to open ./phi-1680.hddm, skip
C the first 25 events and then process to the end of
C that file.  If the event count specified in card
C TRIG is exhausted before this is finished then
C processing will stop at that point.  If the input
C file is exhausted before the TRIG count expires
C (or if no FILE card is given) then processing will
C stop at the end of the input file.

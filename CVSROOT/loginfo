# The "loginfo" file is used to control where "cvs commit" log information is
# sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being made to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, the remainder of the line is a
# filter program that should expect log information on its standard input
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in the
# first field of this file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
#
# The filter program may use one and only one "%s" modifier (ala printf).  If
# such a "%s" is specified in the filter program, a brief title is included
# (as one argument, enclosed in single quotes) showing the relative directory
# name and listing the modified file names.
#
# For example:
ALL (echo $USER; date; cat) | `if [ -f /usr/bin/mailx ]; then echo mailx; else echo mail; fi` -s 'Hall-D CVS: '%s davidl@jlab.org
DEFAULT		(echo ""; who am i; echo %s; date; cat) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog

################ MCROOT Environment ##########################
#  
#
# To compile and build the objects in the
# mcroot directory you will need to have
# the package "root" installed and properly 
# set up (i.e.you must have defined $ROOTSYS,  include
# $ROOTSYS/lib in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and $ROOTSYS/bin in 
# your $path.)
# 
#
# For information on root see:
#   http://root.cern.ch
#
#  If you have root installed then the make
#  should work with no problems.

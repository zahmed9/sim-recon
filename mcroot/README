In /work/halld/stage1_physics there exist data files (*.rdt) which have
been processed through HDFast --the simulation program based upon the Fermilab MCFast framework.  HDFast creates and writes data utilizing ROOT I/O. The data format is a ROOT tree which is a data container similar to but with much less limitations than itape or BOS. Each event occupies a super-branch in the tree which in turns contains sub-branches(a sub-branch is like a itape group or BOS bank). Each sub-branch contains the data structure defined by a C++ object. Adding new branches reduces to creating C++ classes. Currently HDFast save 5 branches, and 1 virtual branch. 

  o hepevt    --contains generated mc information
  o offtrk    --contains the offline(smeared) charged track information
  o tof_trace --contains time-of-flight information 
  o bcal      --contains barrel calorimetry hit in formation
  o ldgSmear  --contains smeared (energy only) lgd gamma information 
  
  + esr       --a virtual event summary constructed from the about branches



See http://www.phys.cmu.edu/halld/MCS.html for more information on the Monte Carlo Framework.

In addition to the data files,  /work/halld/stage1_physics contains example macros (*.C) and executables. See tof.C for example of opening a data file and generating histograms.  Also, EventDisplay.C is, you've guess it, an event display (still a bit crude and slow).  To run the event display type "root .x  EventDisplay.C"  The executable dumpRdt (see /work/halld/src/mcroot/ subsystem on building it) is an example of a program that opens a data file and ascii dumps the branch information. "dumpRdt -h" will provide command line help, and "dumpRdt -n1 file.rdt" will dump one event from file.rdt.

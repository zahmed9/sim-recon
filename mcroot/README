In /work/halld/stage1_physics there exist data files (*.rdt) which have
been processed through HDFast --the simulation program based upon the Fermilab MCFast framework.  HDFast creates and writes data utilizing ROOT I/O. The data format is a ROOT tree which is a data container similar to but with much less limitations than itape or BOS. Each event occupies a super-branch in the tree which in turns contains sub-branches(a sub-branch is like a itape group or BOS bank). Each sub-branch contains the data structure defined by a C++ object. Adding new branches reduces to creating C++ classes. Currently HDFast save 5 branches, and 1 virtual branch. 

  o hepevt    --contains generated mc information
  o offtrk    --contains the offline(smeared) charged track information
  o tof_trace --contains time-of-flight information 
  o bcal      --contains barrel calorimetry hit in formation
  o ldgSmear  --contains smeared (energy only) lgd gamma information 
  
  + esr       --a virtual event summary constructed from the about branches



See http://www.phys.cmu.edu/halld/MCS.html for more information on the Monte Carlo Framework.

In addition to the data files,  /work/halld/stage1_physics contains links to example macros (*.C) and executables. To run a macro first run "root" then at the root prompt type ".x macro.C" or just execute "root .x macro.C"

Macros:

	tof.C -an example of opening a data file and generating histograms

	EventDisplay.C -an event displayer that reads and displays the HDFast 
		geometry and traces particles through the apparatus

Executables:


	dumpRdt -an ascii dumper of the data
		(see /work/halld/src/mcroot/ subsystem on building it) 
		"dumpRdt -h" will provide command line help, and 
		"dumpRdt -n1 file.rdt" will dump one event from file.rdt 

	ntuple_maker -a ntuple maker summarizing the event

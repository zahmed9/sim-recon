\paragraph{Background}
The goal of the GlueX experiment is to search for gluonic excitations
with masses up to $2.5$~GeV.  The identification of such states
requires knowledge about their production mechanism, the
identification of their quantum numbers $J^{PC}$ and their decay
modes. The production mechanism and $J^{PC}$ determination require a
partial wave analysis which in turn depends on the kinematic
identification of exclusive reactions. The decay products of produced
mesons must be identified and measured with good resolution and with
full acceptance in decay angles.  In many cases the decays of mesons
involve a chain of particle decays.  The GlueX detector (see
Figure~\ref{fig:ch6-hd_schematic}) must therefore be hermetic with 
$4\pi$ coverage and have the capability of measuring directions and
energies of photons and momenta of charged particles with good 
resolution.  Particle identification is also required.

\hspace{1cm}
The partial wave analysis technique  depends on high statistics and
in the case of incident photons, also requires linear polarization.
The latter is needed to identify the production mechanism. The linear 
polarization is achieved by the coherent bremsstrahlung technique.  
The degree of linear polarization and flux of photons in the coherent 
peak fall dramatically as the photon energy approaches
the endpoint energy.  On the other hand, it is desirable to have
photon energies high enough to produce the required masses with
sufficient cross section and with sufficient forward boost for good
acceptance. For a fixed incident momentum and a fixed resonance
mass, it is also desirable to have a fairly constant $\mid t\mid_{min}$ over
the natural width of the resonance.  This also requires sufficiently
high incident photon energy. 

\hspace{1cm}
An operating photon energy $9.0$ GeV produced from a $12.0$ GeV 
electron beam represents an optimization of beam flux, cross--section and 
degree of polarization.  The GlueX detector is therefore optimized for 
this energy range. Figure~\ref{fig:ch6-hd_schematic} is a schematic 
representation of the proposed GlueX detector. The individual 
subsystems are discussed in more detail below.


\paragraph{Hall~D and the GlueX Experiment}

The GlueX experiment will be housed in a new above-ground experimental hall
(Hall~D) located at the east end of the CEBAF north linac. A collimated beam 
of linearly polarized photons (with 40\% polarization) of energy 8.5 to 9~GeV 
will be produced via coherent bremsstrahlung from 12~GeV electrons. This 
requires thin diamond  crystal radiators (no more than 20~$\mu$m thick). 
The scattered electron from the bremsstrahlung will be tagged with sufficient 
precision to reconstruct the photon energy to within 0.1\%.


\hspace{1cm}
The GlueX detector uses an existing 2.25~T 
superconducting solenoid that is currently being refurbished.  An existing 
3000-element lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter for detecting photons 
will be reconfigured 
to match the downstream aperture of the solenoid. 
%The collaboration is
%currently looking at a DIRC design based on the SLAC BaBar detector for the
% Cerenkov system. Design work is being carried out with consultation 
% with experts from SLAC.
Particle identification for forward going particles
is accomplished by using a Cerenkov counter 
and scintillator time-of-flight (TOF) system just upstream of the lead-glass 
calorimeter. 
%The Cerenkov Counter is followed by a scintillator 
%time-of-flight (TOF) 
%The TOF wall which in turn is followed by a lead glass 
%calorimeter for detecting photons.  
Inside the full length of the solenoid,
a lead and scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter will provide 
position and energy measurement for photons and TOF information for charged 
particles.  A simple start counter will surround the $30\, cm$ long liquid hydrogen
target. This in turn will be surrounded by a cylindrical straw-tube drift chamber 
which fills the region between the target and the cylindrical calorimeter.  
Planar drift chambers will be placed inside the solenoid downstream of the target
to provide accurate track reconstruction for charged particles going in the 
forward direction.


\hspace{1cm}
This detector configuration has $4 \pi$ hermeticity and momentum/energy and
position information for charged particles and photons produced from 
incoming $9\, GeV$ photons. This detector has been carefully optimized to 
carry out partial wave analysis of many particle final states.  Extensive Monte 
Carlo studies for a wide variety of final states have been carried out to 
certify the design parameters and the suitability of the detector for carrying 
out the final analysis. In particular, the acceptance of the detector for
final state particles is typically above 95\% and is quite uniform over 
the detector. A well understood acceptance is crucial to being able to carry
out precision partial wave analysis. 


\hspace{1cm}
An active program of R\&D has been underway now for several years on each of the 
detector subsystems. Rocking curve measurements of diamond wafers have 
been performed  in the UK, and the coherent bremsstrahlung technique has been 
successfully demonstrated in Hall~B at Jefferson Lab. Prototypes of tracking 
elements and the cylindrical calorimeter have been built and more are planned.  
Beam tests in Russia on TOF prototypes have resulted in a final design.  
Prototype flash ADCs have been built and tested as have TDCs based on F1 chips.  
Work on optimizing electronics continues and more beam tests are planned.  
The magnet is currently being refurbished at the Indiana University Cyclotron 
Facility. 

\hspace{1cm}
The GlueX detector has undergone several reviews carried out by experts from
outside the JLab community. The electronics was reviewed in the summer of
2003, while the entire detector was carefully looked at in the Fall of 2004.
Finally, a a review was performed on the refurbished magnet. All of these
reviews have led to both improvements and optimizations of the GlueX
detector. The primary characteristics of the detector are summarized in 
Table~\ref{tab:gluex_det}.  The hermetic design for the detector makes it 
an ideal tool to determine the masses and quantum numbers of mesons in the 
mass range of $1.5$ to $2.5\, GeV/c^{2}$. The detector will be sensitive 
to hybrid mesons produced with cross sections as low as a few percent
of well known mesons and can also be used to map out both normal mesons and
the poorly known spectra of $s\overline{s}$ mesons.

\hspace{1cm}
\paragraph{Summaries} This document provides a set of one-page summaries for each of the 
major systems in the GlueX detector. These are not meant to be
detailed, complete discussions, but rather a quick overview of the
entire detector. These summaries briefly outline the 
purpose of the system, the requirements placed on the system by
physics goals of GlueX, and a brief description including channel 
count. This continues with  a discussion of the expected raw signals 
as well as needed amplification and final readout of the detector.
A brief discussion of the current stage of R\&D is given with 
outstanding questions pointed out. Finally, the groups and manpower
needed for final construction of the element are identified as 
well as an estimate of the required construction time. 


\hspace{1cm}
It should be pointed out that due to the availability of both manpower
and interest within the collaboration, some systems are much further
along than others. In particular, the Lead-glass Calorimeter is
being built out of glass blocks from an existing device and a great
deal of experience exists. The Forward Drift Chambers were taken on
by the Ohio University group in late 2002, while the collaboration is
currently in discussions with the University of Tennessee and Oak
Ridge groups about taking responsibility for the Cerenkov system.
Independent of this, the collaboration believes that assuming timely
funding of the detector, a viable plan exists for getting physics 
out of the detector in a timely fashion.

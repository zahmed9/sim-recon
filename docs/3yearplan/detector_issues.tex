To facilitate a discussion of major R\&D issues that need to be addressed
in the next few years, it will be useful to develop a table with
a brief description of each. Each issue should be addressed in more detail in an
expanded format as suggested by Alex.

Here is an initial list of issues that first came to my mind, but each subsystem
should review the list both for completeness, priority, and ways to address it.
I suggest that everyone go back to the report of the detector and electronics  reviews 
to pull out
any issues that were raised by them, if they are still relevant.
Once we converge on a list which is fairly complete, we will need to develop a 
plan which can address each of these issues in a systematic way.
In preparation for CD-2 essentially all the design parameters need to be defined
because we will need to develop a detailed cost and schedule basis for the
entire detector.
